## Work Experience
**Data Analyst**, Kearney & Company (February 2024 – Present)  

Contracted for Department of Labor’s (DOL) Employment & Training Administration (ETA) & Office of the Job Corps (OJC)
- **Robotic Process Automation** (RPA): Designed, developed, and maintained three UiPath automation workflows that consolidate and analyze approximately 90,000–105,000 records monthly, reducing manual effort by an estimated 1,560 hours annually (≈0.75 FTE). Automated data validation and requirements confirmation, and delivered curated datasets to Tableau Prep and Tableau to support multiple client-facing dashboards.
- **Financial Forecasting**: Led budget forecasting initiatives for the Department of Labor’s Office of Job Corps to project Student Travel expenditures for the upcoming Program Year. Leveraged ensemble forecasting techniques in R alongside Tableau’s built-in forecasting models to improve accuracy and robustness, enabling more reliable planning, scenario analysis, and informed budgetary decision-making.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Delivered end-to-end analytical solutions for DOL ETA and OJC by integrating large-scale internal and external datasets, developing automated workflows, and applying cost modeling and forecasting techniques to identify efficiency gains, budget optimization opportunities, and high-performing centers. Supported executive decision-making through rigorous database management, multivariate modeling in R and SQL, and the development of client-ready Tableau dashboards and presentations to address both recurring and ad hoc analytical needs.


## Projects
### NFL Dashboard
[2025 NFL Skill Position Dashboard](https://adamtwhite98-data.github.io/nfl-2025-dashboard/)
This dashboard presents advanced performance metrics and predictive insights for running backs, wide receivers, quarterbacks, and teams, integrating play-by-play–derived analytics with forward-looking models. It is designed to support data-driven evaluation, comparison, and decision-making across player and team contexts throughout the season.

### NBA ML Dashboard
[2023 NBA Machine Learning Application](https://adamtwhite98-data.github.io/NBA-2023-Machine-Learning/)
This interactive R Shiny dashboard explores 2023 NBA data through a machine learning lens, applying and comparing multiple modeling approaches to player and team outcomes. Methods include logistic regression, multiple linear regression, ridge regression, natural cubic splines, k-nearest neighbors, and naïve Bayes, enabling model-driven analysis, performance comparison, and interpretability across basketball contexts.

### NFL Wide Receiver Archetype K-Means Clustering writeup:
[Receiver Archetype Write Up](https://github.com/adamtwhite98-data/nfl-reciever-archetype)
This project clusters NFL wide receivers by per-play usage and efficiency rather than raw volume, using play-by-play–derived metrics to identify players performing at an elite level despite limited opportunities. Applying PCA, Euclidean distance, and k-means clustering to nflfastR data reveals four distinct receiver archetypes—ranging from all-around WR1s to deep threats and YAC specialists—providing a data-driven framework for player evaluation and comparison beyond traditional box score statistics.
