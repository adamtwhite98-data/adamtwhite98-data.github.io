## Work Experience
<p align="center"> Analyst, Kearney & Company (_February 2024 – Present_) </p>
<p align="center"> Contracted for Department of Labor’s (DOL) Employment & Training Administration (ETA) & Office of the Job Corps (OJC) </p>
• Robotic Process Automation: Automates large-scale processes for DOL’s ETA and OJC by leveraging internal and external data. Improves efficiency, reduces costs, and minimizes human error for the Budget Team through streamlined operations. Day to day includes development, maintenance, troubleshooting, and consistent validation of expected process fulfillment.
• Data Analytics: Internal and external data location, extraction, cleaning, and joining to complete advanced analytics to provide the OJC’s Budget Team with specific improvement opportunities, as well as high performing Center’s capable of expansion. Consistently assisted on Ad-Hoc requests from the Client which requires extreme familiarity with the data the Job Corps provides. Typically involve verbal and visual presentations.
• Cost Modelling: Utilized multiple datasets and computed the optimal student to staff ratio, personnel category allocations, and position title allocations. This was then compared to previous salary data for the corresponding position to model the effective savings based on the increase/decrease of staffing, based on student levels.
• Database Management: Maintained PostgreSQL and Access databases supporting 1M+ records. Created ETL pipelines using SQL and R to extract, clean and load datasets from multiple sources into a centralized data bank. Normalized databases to ensure accuracy and efficiency of ETL process.
• Financial Forecasting: Conducted budget forecasting for DOL’s OJC to project Student Travel spending for the next Program Year. Used a combination of multivariate regression in R and Tableau’s forecasting tools to improve accuracy.
• Data Visualization: For each specific job requirements above, worked with output data first in Tableau Prep and then Tableau to create and maintain client- ready dashboards. Ad-hoc requests with varying requirements would also require the creation of easy to digest Tableau views.
